Beyond Meat, Impossible Burgers and other meat alternatives. Electric cars. LED lights. Grow trees. But there are so many other solutions in the sphere that rarely get mentioned, and have substantial impacts on the planet. This article explores just a few that I found to be very promising and under-appreciated. Drawing mainly from <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Project Drawdown</a> (an awesome organization that everyone should know about) combined with other influences such as Saul Griffith “<a href=\"https://www.saulgriffith.com/blog/solving-climate-change-with-a-loan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Solving Climate Change with a Loan</a>”, here’s a few criteria for the solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is based on technology that already exists. While future technology is cool (think <a href=\"https://generalfusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">create energy like the sun</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.prometheusfuels.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">make fuel from air</a>), it is uncertain. From first-prototype to large-scale deployment (1% of a national market), energy technologies in the past requires <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/clean-energy-innovation/innovation-needs-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario#abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">20–70 years</a>. While other types of technology timescales might be shorter, we need to be certain that these things work. (that doesn’t mean R&#x26;D for new tech is not important, especially in the field of carbon capture and storage because they can reverse the carbon dioxide emission. But we also need to be realistic and not bet on those things)</li>\n<li>It has large influence on carbon emissions. Since the world’s current emission is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">nearly 40 Gigaton/yea</a>r, a good solution must reduce at least 0.4 Gigaton of CO2/year. While that does not sound like a lot, it is 1% of the global emission on 1 single solution. And the solutions here all have the potential to surpass that requirement.</li>\n<li>It needs to be cost-efficient. We are not looking for solutions that might cost us in the long run (eg. refrigerant management). While these policies are important nonetheless, they will more likely require government policies to make it work, which limit the scope of action.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on the above criteria, here are 5 solutions that I think we need to discuss more in order to make decarbonization a reality:</p>\n<h1 id=\"enhanced-weathering\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#enhanced-weathering\" aria-label=\"enhanced weathering permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enhanced Weathering</h1>\n<p><strong>Potential carbon sequestered: 40 Gigaton/year (Yes, the entire world’s emission. Read more below)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Potential profit: ~-480 billion dollars</strong></p>\n<p>Now, why did I lay out the ground rule of being cost-efficient and break them in the first solution with a negative number? This is because this solution is the inspiration for me to write this article in the first place.</p>\n<p>Current carbon capture and storage (think sucking carbon from the air) cost a lot: <a href=\"https://projectvesta.org/science/#dflip-df_77/1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>70</mn><mo>−</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">70-</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">7</span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span>80/tonne</a>. Not to mention they often require expensive technology that will require massive scaling. In come enhanced weathering. The idea is, we find a mineral called olivine, crush it up, and lay it in the beaches around the world. The beaches will turn green as a result (like this one that already exist in Hawaii), and the sand would interact with water from waves and carbon dioxide in the air to form carbon-rich sediments that would be sent to the ocean floor, and stay there for millions of years. Naturally, this happen for thousand of years. With humans’ intervention, the whole cycle takes 1–2 years.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dI7xruPdIpapNN0F.jpg\" alt=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dI7xruPdIpapNN0F.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Green sand beach (Papakōlea, Hawaii). Photo taken from <a href=\"https://droneandslr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/papakolea-green-sand-beach-hawaii-7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s the catch: we already have abundant olivine in the world (it is the most abundant mineral in the upper mantle of the Earth). We only need <a href=\"https://projectvesta.org/plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">0.14% of Earth’s shore</a> to offset global emission. More importantly, they cost a lot, lot less than any other carbon capture technology: when scaling up, it will cost roughly <a href=\"https://projectvesta.org/science/#dflip-df_77/1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">$12/tonne.</a> That is a five-fold reduction in carbon storage price. And if we want to offset the entire world’s emission, we will need 480 billion dollars. That may sound like a lot, except it’s only <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">0.5% global GDP</a> a year. The US currently spends <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">1.5 times more</a> for military funding.</p>\n<p>Why is this better than planting trees? Because 1. We will need a lot more lands for trees to capture the same amount of carbon. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">11% of land use will be needed to sequester 2/3rd of current emission.</a> 2. Trees do not sequester carbon dioxide infinitely. They release some carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere when decayed. This approach will sequester carbon dioxide indefinitely.</p>\n<p>This solution is undertaken most notably by <a href=\"https://projectvesta.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Project Vesta</a>. They are still in the very early stage, but the technology is there. If this is successful, we will have a lot to be hopeful about.</p>\n<h1 id=\"girls-education-and-healthcare\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#girls-education-and-healthcare\" aria-label=\"girls education and healthcare permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Girls’ Education and Healthcare</h1>\n<p><strong>Potential carbon sequestered: 2.8 Gigaton/year (<a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/health-and-education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">85.4 Gigaton/ 2020–2050</a>)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Potential profit: Not calculated, but potentially trillion of dollars</strong></p>\n<p>What does education and healthcare have to do with climate change?

And it also includes many different practices inside. But here’s the gist:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have been farming unsustainably since the Green Revolution. We have used too much fertilizer and pesticide, and while they increase yield in the short run, they also degrade the land and lower yield in the long run. Meanwhile, the mono crop culture (using an entire piece of land for only 1 type of products) while efficient, is highly vulnerable to diseases. The treatment of farmed animals are simply horrific.</li>\n<li>Agriculture accounts for <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">24% of global emissions</a>. While most of it comes from animals (specifically beef, pork and lamb), <em>some</em> plants are also the culprits (did you know rice paddy fields release methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide?). Furthermore, farming plants can also be used to sequestered carbon dioxide.</li>\n<li>There are already ways for us to use less water, less fertilizer, less pesticides, WHILE increasing yield and decreasing our carbon dioxide emission. They also allow for better adaptation to our already changing climate. Some doesn’t even require initial cost — it’s completely free to implement. It’s a complete win-win.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What are some of these farming practices?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VtBwhzbHs7roHf1S.jpg\" alt=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VtBwhzbHs7roHf1S.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Silvopasture — one of many sustainable farming practices.

It requires higher up-front cost, but has massive profit over time. Furthermore, pastures and trees together sequester 5–10 times more carbon than those that are treeless.</li>\n<li>Age-old <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/conservation-agriculture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">conservation farming techniques</a>: diverse crop, creating their own pesticides and fertilizers, and increase crop rotation, maintain crop cover all increase the carbon sequestered and the land more resilient.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/perennial-staple-crops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Grow more avocado and banana trees</a>! Instead of annual crops (like rice and wheats, which is produced annually and cut down after they are harvested), if farmers grow more perennial crops that are trees with fruits harvested yearly, more carbon will be stored. These staple tree crops will also reduce soil erosion, fertilizer and pesticide needs, and more. There’s now more reason to eat avocados!</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"financial-services\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#financial-services\" aria-label=\"financial services permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Financial services</h1>\n<p><strong>Potential carbon sequestered: Unknown</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Potential profit: Not calculated</strong></p>\n<p>This is the part often missing from climate conversation: we need money to make this happen, loans in particular. Many of the best farming practices require upfront costs, which poor farmers cannot afford. Other requires financing to scale up production to meet with growing needs (bamboo production, enhanced weathering). And financing can create second and third-order effects (eg. a family with enough money will be more likely to enroll their daughters in schools). And many other solutions not mentioned here (eg. solar rooftops) require home investments.</p>\n<p>Thus, we need better loans. Microfinances, for instance, provides loans to low-income people usually with no access to financial services, thus allowing them to have enough money to start a business, pay an unexpected cost, and so on. Other financial methods could work. For instance, SolarCity would install solar rooftops in households with no cost upfront, and would sell the energy back to the consumer at a lower rate than normal utility. We could extend that to a similar service for farming practices, for instance, where farmers would pay no upfront cost for implementing more sustainable solutions, instead pay in installment through part of the increased profit every year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DLIdUCrEkZ3NjEOs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DLIdUCrEkZ3NjEOs</a></p>\n<p>A new model of solar panels from Tesla, now the parent company of SolarCity.
