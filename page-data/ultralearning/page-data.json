Coincidentally, as I was planning, my friend Esther introduced me to this book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/B07ST3Z1Q6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D02KJQQ8NWAE&#x26;dchild=1&#x26;keywords=ultralearning&#x26;qid=1589173668&#x26;sprefix=ultralearning%2Caps%2C197&#x26;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ultralearning</a> by Scott Young, famous for his MIT challenge where he learnt 4 years of MIT-undergraduate computer science curriculum in a year. Naturally, I was curious not just at his dedication, but his efficiency, and wanted to implement it with my summer plan. After reading and taking notes, I feel the need to share them, so more people can understand the framework, and work on it as well. Thus, I present the following two posts:</p>\n<p>In post 1, I will re-structure the framework that was given by Ultralearning and create a checklist as to how to learn most effectively.</p>\n<p>In post 2, I will lay out how I plan to apply the Ultralearning principles into my summer plan. This is mostly personal, but I do hope it gives some ideas as to how to apply them in a specific context, outside of learning at school.</p>\n<p>These are, by no means, a substitution for the book itself. This is meant as a condense summary to go over after you have finished reading the book, and understand the principles deeply. In many ways, this series is a commitment for me to apply what I have already learnt from the book into real life.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s begin.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-fundamentals-behind-ultralearning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-fundamentals-behind-ultralearning\" aria-label=\"3 fundamentals behind ultralearning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3 Fundamentals behind Ultralearning</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>It is hard.</li>\n<li>It is self-directed.</li>\n<li>It varies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Number 1 is the most important: this is not going to be easy. It’s not going to give you tips and tricks on how to pass an exam in a night, or master something in two seconds. If you are looking for last-minute tips and tricks, this is not the framework for you. But it is going to be rewarding, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Number 2 means, you are in control. You can set the goals and the directions. It means if you succeed, it’s you who claim that success entirely.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no one way of doing this. Common themes emerge, but everyone has a different way of approaching it. There is no right or wrong way. But there are better ways than others.</p>\n<h1 id=\"principle-1-metalearning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principle-1-metalearning\" aria-label=\"principle 1 metalearning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principle 1: Metalearning</h1>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Learning about learning. Research on the topic before you start.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong> To ensure 1. You are learning the right skills. 2. You are getting the best resources for that skill.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>10% rule:</strong> Spend roughly 10% of your total learning time doing research</li>\n<li>Identify <strong>Why</strong> you want to learn. For instance, are you learning it for enjoyment, or to further your career?</li>\n<li>Identify <strong>What</strong> you want to learn <strong>specifically.</strong> Mandarin is vague, speaking Mandarin with a native speaker for 15 minutes is much better.</li>\n<li><strong>Interview experts:</strong> ask people who are in the position you hope to be in whether what you are learning will be relevant, and how to go about doing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Benchmarking</strong> — have something to measure your progress. For instance, a school curriculum, or a recording every day.</li>\n<li><strong>Emphasize</strong> things that align with your goal, and <strong>Remove</strong> those that don’t. eg. If you want to <em>speak</em> Mandarin, <em>emphasize</em> listening and speaking, and <em>remove</em> writing and reading.</li>\n<li><strong>Be flexible</strong> — Change your plan as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principle-2focus\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principle-2focus\" aria-label=\"principle 2focus permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principle 2: Focus</h1>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The ability to concentrate on the task at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong> To do something hard, you need to put efforts in.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be aware</strong> of your procrastination habits: how it arises and why it arises.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge yourself slowly.</strong> Have crutches: if you don’t want to start, set a 5-minute timer to do the work at hand. If you are not focused after multiple 5-minute timers, try a 25-minute <a href=\"https://tomato-timer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pomodoro Technique timer</a>. Build it slowly. Create your rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Have an environment that works.</strong> This means no distractions (eg. phone notifications), have the right amount of “arousal” — eg. some tasks may work with music, others do not.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t multitask. Do interleave.</strong> Don’t try to do 4 things at once. But you can vary 4 different concepts in 1 session instead of focusing on just one.</li>\n<li><strong>Use better sources</strong>. The more active the source, the better you will learn. Eg. instead of watching a lecture and falling asleep, try the problem sets. Or if lectures are unavoidable, try to create a flowchart as you are watching/listening.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a break</strong>. A lot of problems get solved when you are not actively thinking about it. Have time for the problem to permeate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principle-3-directness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principle-3-directness\" aria-label=\"principle 3 directness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principle 3: Directness</h1>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Do not just observe, play an active role.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong> It’s difficult to transfer knowledge in a new, different context. So whenever possible, learn and apply what you learn straight away.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Project-based learning:</strong> eg. Create an app to learn programming.</li>\n<li><strong>Immersive learning</strong> eg. living in the country you want to learn the language from.</li>\n<li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Be as close to the real experience as possible. eg. Do a practice test in a timed, closed-book environment. Play chess with a chess clock.</li>\n<li><strong>Make it public:</strong> Try to set yourself against a public standard, whenever possible. This will also help with principle 6, Feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principle-4drill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principle-4drill\" aria-label=\"principle 4drill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principle 4: Drill</h1>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Focus on a particular skill that you are weakest in.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong> Usually there is a bottleneck skill that slow your learning down significantly. If you can get better at this skill, you will progress a lot faster.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time slicing:</strong> focus repeatedly on a particular segment eg. repeating the part you are bad at in a piano song.</li>\n<li><strong>Isolate and focus</strong> on one component. eg. only drawing the eye instead of the whole face</li>\n<li><strong>Copy</strong> what others have done to <strong>focus</strong> on the part you want to improve. eg. To improve writing style, copy a paragraph from the author, and try re-writing with your own words. Compare and contrast.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend significantly more time</strong> in that particular skill when practicing</li>\n<li><strong>Prerequisite chaining:</strong> Start doing, when you get stuck, go back one step, learn what is needed, and continue. eg. Start programming and integrating other libraries and frameworks along the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"principle-5-retrieval\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principle-5-retrieval\" aria-label=\"principle 5 retrieval permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principle 5: Retrieval</h1>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Not forgetting what you have learnt (similar to Principle 7, Retention, but this is more focused on the short-term).</p>\n<p><strong>Why it’s important:</strong> In whatever you learn, you will need to remember things. There are ways to learn and remember better than reading and re-reading.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flashcards.</strong> Mainly for facts.

At the same time, I have condensed it as much as possible. My intention is for me and others to have a quick reference point when starting a new learning project, without the need to re-read the book. In addition, as promise at the beginning of the post, this is the checklist for every learning project, lightly edited:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Checklist-for-learning-project-e8af050062c04ff3a5c8983d67598c45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Checklist for your learning project</a></p>\n<p>I want to re-emphasize the fundamentals of the book: It is going to be <strong>hard,</strong> it is going to be <strong>driven by you,</strong> and <strong>there is no single right way.</strong> And if I can add one more, it would be <strong>it takes time.</strong> Be consistent and you will get there.</p>\n<p>Hope you find it as useful as I did. Happy learning!</p>","excerpt":"With 4 months of summer stretching across the horizons, I know I want to embark on a personal learning journey where I can make the most us…","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#3-fundamentals-behind-ultralearning\">3 Fundamentals behind Ultralearning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-1-metalearning\">Principle 1: Metalearning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-2focus\">Principle 2: Focus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-3-directness\">Principle 3: Directness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-4drill\">Principle 4: Drill</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-5-retrieval\">Principle 5: Retrieval</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-6feedback\">Principle 6: Feedback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-7-retention\">Principle 7: Retention</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-8-intuition\">Principle 8: Intuition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#principle-9-experimentation\">Principle 9: Experimentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ultralearning/#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/ultralearning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How To Learn Most Effectively - An Ultra-learning Framework","date":"May 06, 2021","tags":["books","growth"],"keywords":["Ha Tran Nguyen Phuong","Ha"],"update":"Jan 01, 0001"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ultralearning/","series":[],"lastmod":"2021-05-06"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2027115977","694178885"]}
